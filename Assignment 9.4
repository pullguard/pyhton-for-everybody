9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. 
After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
counts = dict()
for line in handle:
    # Iterate over line and detect line starting with "From "
    if line.startswith("From "):
        # split the line
        emails = line.split()
        # Capture emails address into variable: emails
        emails = emails[1]
        counts[emails] = counts.get(emails, 0) + 1
# count occurances of unique email address 
# and store them in counts
emailcount = None
emailaddress = None
# Iterate over counts tuples
for address, count in counts.items():
    # Maximum loop
    if emailcount is None or count > emailcount:
        emailcount = count
        emailaddress = address
print(emailaddress, emailcount)
