10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

Desired output: 
04 3
06 1
07 1
09 2
10 3
11 6
14 1
15 2
16 4
17 2
18 1
19 1

name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
counts = dict()
for line in handle:
    if line.startswith("From "):
        # Split it twice and take the hour and store it in to hours, set hours into list
        hours = (line.split()[5]).split(":")[0]
        counts[hours] = counts.get(hours, 0) + 1
# Assign k and v in to newtup and append to lst
lst = list()
for k, v in counts.items():
    newtup = (k,v)
    lst.append(newtup)
# Print according to desired output
lst = sorted(lst)
for x, y in lst:
    print(x,y)
